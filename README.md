## Wheel of Prosperity project
This project consists of the creation of a 24-question quiz, based on an answer ranging from 0 to 10.
The result will be accompanied by a "wheel of prosperity" visual that will show the curve of the results. 
The wheel has 12 different coloured spokes and the 24 questions are grouped in pairs to give an average for each spoke.

I worked on the project as a final project at Cornerstone International Community College in 2020 and met the client through [Riipen](https://www.riipen.com/).
